# Warning
The source code is released as is, warts and all, with all last minute fixes hacked together on the plane / train, or 4am the night before opening etc. 


# Dependencies
Current version built on OSX 10.9.3

Written mainly in C++ with [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc)
(current version built with v0.8.2)

Uses [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) for audio synthesis

Requires D2xx FTDI drivers for RS485 comms. v1.4.4 included in repo. Alternatively download latest drivers from <http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm>. (they're also included in the repo)

In order for them to work, you need to disable your own FTDI drivers - you can install D2xxHelper in ftdi/installers or you can also do this manually on the command line by typing:

sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI

then to reload it, it's:

sudo kextload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI
