# Warning
The source code is released as is, warts and all, with all last minute fixes hacked together on the plane / train, or 4am the night before opening etc. 


# Dependencies
Current version built on OSX 10.12.5

Written mainly in C++ with [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc)
(current version built with v0.10.0)

Uses [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) for audio synthesis

Requires D2xx FTDI drivers for RS485 comms. v1.2.2 included in repo.  (do not use the latest version (1.4.4) - I think it's less stable)Alternatively download from <http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm>. 

In order for them to work, you need to disable your own FTDI drivers - you can install D2xxHelper in ftdi/installers or you can also do this manually on the command line by typing:

sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI

then to reload it, it's:

sudo kextload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI
