# Warning
The source code is released as is, warts and all, with all last minute fixes hacked together on the plane / train, or 4am the night before opening etc. 


# Dependencies
Current version built on OSX 10.12.5

Written mainly in C++ with [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc)
(current version built with v0.10.0 - at the time it was the current master in github)

Uses [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) for audio synthesis

Requires D2xx FTDI drivers for RS485 comms. v1.2.2 included in repo.  (do not use the latest version (1.4.4) - I think it's less stable)Alternatively download from <http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm>. You need to open the disk image then do what it says in the readme. When copying the dylib from the source folder you might need to change the path to reflect the latest operating system.

Next you need to copy ftdi/ftd2xx.cfg to /usr/local/lib. It's a config file for how the driver works, forcing the driver to reset the serial device when it reopens it. Not 100% sure we need this but it can't hurt.

In order for them to work, you need to disable your own FTDI drivers - you can install D2xxHelper in ftdi/installers or you can also do this manually on the command line by typing:

sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI

then to reload it, it's:

sudo kextload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI
